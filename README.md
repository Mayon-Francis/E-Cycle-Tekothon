# E Cycle - TBD - TEK-O-THON

## Problem Statement
 Almost 50 million metric ton e-waste are disposed every year. The environmental and health issues create by e-waste are really lethal. Every year only 12% e-waste are recycled. The adversities are so high that just 2% of e-waste causes 70% of toxic waste. Also people don't know what to do with their e-waste/
 
 ## Solution
 E-cycle provides user options to donate or monatize their e-waste.
 A user need to first input their applaince details and select the way they wanna dispose the e-waste. 
 - User can sell the reusable parts to repairers or 2nd hand parts dealer. The main motive of selling to repairers is that, it would help middle class people who can't afford expensive applaince parts to fix their applainces at low cost. This way user can get money from the useful parts of his e-waste.
 - User can or else return it to the company the applaince belongs to, to avail reward points. These points can be redeemed later for discounts or other stuff
 - If the product is in working condition, then the user can donate it to NGOs so that needy can use it.
